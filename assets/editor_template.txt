# IMPORTANT: Sections are separated by a newline!
#
# The scope is optional. If not provided, leave out the parantheses.
# If this is a breaking change, prefix the colon with a `!`.
# The line should not be longer than 50 characters at most:
# -> fix(<scope>?)!: <short_msg>
#
# Examples:
# - fix: some short message
# - fix(parser)!: allow whitespace support
# - revert(engine): revert new utility functions for context rendering

# The long message. This can be used to further explain certain implementation details
# or other convey other information. Each line should not be longer than 80 characters.

# If there are breaking changes in this patch (aka you used an `!` earlier after the
# scope), then a short list of what exactly is a breaking change. The explanation
# can be span over multiple lines, but should as well wrap at around 80 characters:
# -> BREAKING CHANGES: <explanation>

# Footer section. This section can be used to provide metainformation in a key-value
# format. Popular ones are `Fixes`, `Closes`, `PR-Close`, `Signed-off-by`, `Reverts`
# and `Approved-by`. The format is `<key>: <value>` or `<key> #<value>`. This allows
# issue-related footer information to be more readable:
# -> Fixes #123
# -> PR-Close #444
# -> Reverts: f19e80f
# -> Approved-by: John Doe


# Example commit messsage containing all of the above (starts at the line with fix in it):
#
# fix(engine)!: lighting artifacts during post-processing
#

# The proposed fix introduces a new function argument to `render_buffer` that is
# necessary to prevent these kind of artifacts.
#
# BREAKING CHANGES: Function signature for `render_buffer` changed.
#
# Fixes #123
# PR-Close #444
